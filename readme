You create new platforms by left-clicking the board at the bottom of the screen. You can adjust its rotation with the arrow keys or the 'a' and 'd' keys. 
Place the platforms by left clicking. You can pick them up again by ctrl + left clicking them. 
The board has a radius around it that needs to be empty before it will place, depicted by a white circle.
Right-clicking or pressing the 'shift' key lets you move the arrow on the ball, which is the direction that it launches at. left clicking locks that direction in place.
Launch the ball with the enter key.
